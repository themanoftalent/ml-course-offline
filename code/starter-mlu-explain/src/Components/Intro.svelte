    In our <a href="https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/"> 
      previous discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff</a
    >, we ended with a note about one of modern machine learning's more
    surprising phenomena: <span class="bold">double descent</span>. Double
    descent is interesting because it appears to stand counter to our
    classical understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff. Namely, while
    we expect the best model perfrrormance to be obtained via some balance
    between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting), we instead
    observe strong test performance from very overfit, complex models.
