    Neural networks have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and
    are the backbone of popular algorithms today, such as ChatGPT,
    Stable-Diffusion, and many others. In this visual introduction, we'll
    journey through the fundamentals of feed-forward neural networks, starting
    from their essential components, understanding their learning mechanisms,
    and even getting hands-on experience by interacting with one ourselves.

    Neural networks are networks - that much is clear. <i
      >But what is a "network"?</i
    >
    A network is a structure consisting of interconnected computational nodes, or
    'neurons', arranged in layers. These nodes perform mathematical operations on
    input data, learning some underlying patterns in the data, before producing some
    output based on those patterns. If this sounds confusing, don't worry, we'll
    make it clear soon enough.
    <br /><br />
    To build up our intuition, we'll walk through constructing a basic computational
    graph into a Neural Network:
