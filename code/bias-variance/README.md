This repo holds code for the MLU-Explain visual essay: A Visual Introduction to the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

To view the essay, first clone the repo, then:

```
# install libraries
npm i

# view dev version
npm run start
```

To view the full 'build' (i.e. the version we'll want to use in production):

```
npm run build
```

Then all of the assets will be available in the `dist` directory. Simply use that.

To view a live version of the build, cd into that `dist` dir and run a live-server.
