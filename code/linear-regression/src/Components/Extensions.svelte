  The study of linear regression is a very deep topic: there's a ton of
  different things to talk about and we'd be foolish to try to cover them all in
  one single article. Some of those topics left unmentioned are: regularization
  methods, selection techniques, common regression transformations, bayesian
  formulations of regression, and additional evaluation techniques. For those
  interested in learning more, we recommend diving deep into the aforementioned
  topics, or reading the resources below. Hopefully this article serves as a
  nice starting point for learning about linear regression.
