  The F1-score combines the precision and recall of a classifier into a single
  metric by taking their harmonic mean. It is primarily used to compare the
  performance of two classifiers. Suppose that classifier A has a higher recall,
  and classifier B has higher precision. In this case, the F1-scores for both
  the classifiers can be used to determine which one produces better results.
  The F1-score of a classification model is calculated as follows:
